Instructions on how to use github:
$ represents entering a command in command prompt (don't include $)
While entering any command dealing with the repository it needs to be your working directory
View directories and files with: $ dir
Change directory with: $ cd <directory to change to>

- Download and install git
  - https://gitforwindows.org
  - Check if it worked
  - $ git --version
      
- Fork repository to your own account
  - Press the button in the upper right hand corner
  
- Clone your forked version
  This will place your forked version onto your machine so you can edit it from there
  - Press green clone button and copy the url address
  - $ git clone <paste url here>
  You now have a cloned version on your machine
 
- Make a branch
  Whenever you start working on something new make a branch
  This way if you mess it up and make it stop working you can just delete the branch and go back
  - $ git branch <branch name>
  You are now working in the new branch
  
- Commit changes
  Do this every time you succesfully add a new feature or change something important
  - Commit: $ git commit -a
    It will open up a txt file, enter comments on what you changed
    To exit txt editor press ':' and then 'wq' and enter
  - If there are new files (untracked files): git add .
    You will then need to commit again
    
- Merge branches
  Pretty self explanitory this merges the branches
  - Switch to main branch: $ git checkout master
    git checkout can also be used to switch to any branch
  - Merge: $ git merge <branch to be merged with master>
    
- Push to git
  Saves your cloned version to your forked version on github
  - $ git push
  
- Submit pull request
  Reconnects your forked version to the main repository
  - On github.com navigate to your forked version and press 'new pull request'
  - This will send a request where the changes in files can be discussed and added to the main version
